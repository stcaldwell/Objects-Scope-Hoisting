Scope
- Study the code bellow and answer the following without checking the console.
- Are the variables what they claim to be?
- What would console.log(y) and console.log(x) print? Why?
- Write you answer bellow the code.
**************************************************************************************/
(function(){
  "use strict";

  var x = "I'm a local variable";
  //console.log(y)

  function scopeThis(){
    var y = "I'm a global variable";
    console.log(x);
  }
  scopeThis();
})();
/*************************************************************************************
------------ ANSWER -------------------
y is a local variable. x is a global variable.
console.log y wouldn't print anything because var y is inside the scopeThis and the console.log is outside of it so it wouldn't know to call it.
Console.log(x) would print out I am a local variable.

- Study the code below and answer the following without checking the console.
- What would console.log(x) and console.log(y) print? Why?
- Write you answer bellow the code.
**************************************************************************************/
(function(){
  "use strict";

  function warmUp() {

    var x = "variable hosting!";

    function foo() {
      return "function hoisting";
    }
  }
  warmUp();
})();
/*************************************************************************************
------------ ANSWER -------------------
console.log(x) won't return anything or it will return undefined because you are printing the x before you give it a value.
console.log(foo()) will return function hoisting. because it is calling a function and it doensn't matter where a function is.

Date Object
- Declare a variable 'todayIs'.
- Using the date constructor, it should print today's date.

  var todayIs = new Date();

  console.assert(todayIs == today, "#3 Test failed. Did you set the date correctly?");

/**************************************************************************************

Warm up
- Study the code below. What will console.log(add) (inside the IFEE and outside) print? Why? Write your answer below.
- Do not uncomment console.log(add);
**************************************************************************************/
(function() {
  "use strict";
  const add = 2 + 2;
  //console.log(add);

/**************************************************************************************
------------ ANSWER -------------------
console.log(add) will return 4.
console.log(add) outside the function will print undefined.

  - add a property of "protien" with a value of "chicken".
  - add a propety of "orderNow" with a value of that would make it pass the assertion.

Object notation
- Study the code below, line by line, carefully. Keep hoisting and scope in mind.
- Add the following properties to 'benefit' using bracket notation:
  - "credit" with a value of 50.
  - "discount" with a value of 5.
- Complete the missing return statement.
- 'name' must be set to 'James' as a local variable in one of the functions. It should also change the global variable in order for the assertion to pass.
-It should return: "Hello James. Here is the status of your account. Thank you for your loyalty. You've been a member for 18 months . You next bill will reflect a $50 credit and a 5% discount going forward."
HINTS:
- Don't be overwhelmed by the length of the function. Read the instructions carefully. Read it line by line, keeping hoisting and scope in mind. You've got this.
- First fix hoisting issues.
- One of the variables is missing something.
- Are the functions being called when they are supposed to?
